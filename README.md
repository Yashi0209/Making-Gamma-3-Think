What I've Learned
In this fun project, I've learned how to:

Set up model accelerated fine-tuning

Prepare data for GRPO training

Define custom reward functions to guide the model's learning

Train a model using GRPO

Test the fine-tuned model

Save the model in various formats

About GRPO
GRPO is a powerful technique for aligning language models with specific behaviors. By combining multiple reward functions, we can guide the model to follow a specific format while also improving its reasoning capabilities.
